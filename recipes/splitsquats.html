        <h1>Bulgarian Split Squat Lunges</h1>
        <p><h2>Equipment:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A bench or plyo-box, lower one is okay too</li>
                <li>2 dumbbells (Total weight should be ~30-40% of max resistance in a deadlift)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit at the edge of the bench or box. Stick one leg straight out. This is roughly where your front (standing) leg will be placed. Place the two dumbbells on each side of yoru front foot.</li>
                <li>Place the top of your back foot on the edge of the bench/box. For better balance you can offset it to the side a little</li>
                <li>Start in a low lunge with your upper body leaning forward so that your hands are holding the dumbells while they are on the floor. Gaze should be on the floor a couple yards in front of you.</li>
                <li>Engage your front leg's glute and push straight up from the lunge, lifting the dumbbells with you. <strong>Your core should be engaged</strong>. You can choose to straighten your torso for a more traditional lunge position, or maintain a slight tilt forward.</li>
                <li>Pause at the top, then hinge forward at your hips for a single legged deadlift. Make sure your upper body moves a single unit, keep your head in line with your spine (face should be parallel to the floor at the bottom of the 90 degree hinge)</li>
                <li>Engage your glutes as you lift back up</li>
                <li>Repeat each lunge+lift 8-12 times</li>
                <li>Take a quick break to shake out your legs. Then repeat on the other side.</li>
                <li>Rest - walk around to shake out your legs and stretch them.</li>
                <li>Repeat both legs for 3-4 total sets. Option to start each set with the opposite leg first</li>
                <li><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure your rests in between each set is enough to allow you to go all out with your reps.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Important notes:</strong> As you do each exercise, focus on engaging your glutes, and adjust your position/speed/weight to get the most out of each movement. During the lunges, leaning forward will allow you to focus less on the quads. During the deadlift, bending your knees and pushing your hip back will help take less weight off your hamstrings.</p>
