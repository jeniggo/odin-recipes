        <p>There are four movements that target the glute muscles:
            <ul>
                <li>thrust</li>
                <li>hinge</li>
                <li>squat</li>
                <li>abduct</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>Each movement targets the glutes or a certain area of the glutes, but may also engage other muscles (hammies and quads). Because I am quad-dominant, I tend to grow my thighs more than my glute. To solve this, I've worked on finding workouts that combine these movements in a way to target my glutes more.
        </p>
       
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> For all exercises, make sure that your <em>core is tight</em>, you are thinking about your <em>butt flexing</em> with each movement (adjust your position/speed/weights as needed), and that you are <em>breathing</em>.</p>
